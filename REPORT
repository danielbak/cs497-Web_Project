For this first version I was able to finish the front end design as planned.
I used the synfony framework for the back end along with the bootstrap framework for the front-end design.
I also use the composer tool to bundle the different tools and technology that I might need in the future. 
So far I use composer to install synfony and bootstrap.
I have created a home page, login page and register page.
The next step will be to deploy what I have so far on Heroku and creating a login feature.

For this second version I have worked on the setting up the FOSUserBundle in the symfony app. 
This bundle will help with user registration, login and user account as well as profile for the app.
I am still working on tweaking and customizing the bundle for the purpose of that app. 
The work ahead will consist in finishing the customization portion and moving on to picking 
a different bundle to manage the documents that will be uploaded.

I worked on customizing the FOSUserBundle and installing the zend framework 
containing the lucene search API adapted for php. For the next step 
I need to work on having a module that can help manage documents 
and defining how the search will be done.
