For this first version I was able to finish the front end design as planned.
I used the synfony framework for the back end along with the bootstrap framework for the front-end design.
I also use the composer tool to bundle the different tools and technology that I might need in the future. 
So far I use composer to install synfony and bootstrap.
I have created a home page, login page and register page.
The next step will be to deploy what I have so far on Heroku and creating a login feature.

For this second version I have worked on the setting up the FOSUserBundle in the symfony app. 
This bundle will help with user registration, login and user account as well as profile for the app.
I am still working on tweaking and customizing the bundle for the purpose of that app. 
The work ahead will consist in finishing the customization portion and moving on to picking 
a different bundle to manage the documents that will be uploaded.

I worked on customizing the FOSUserBundle and installing the zend framework 
containing the lucene search API adapted for php. For the next step 
I need to work on having a module that can help manage documents 
and defining how the search will be done.

I worked on getting a first version of the website that will allow 
users to upload their documents in to the website and performed 
some search query to find the most relevant documents that they need.
There is a login/registration feature and also a space where users can 
search for relevants document. However this is not enought to have 
the website be user friendly and useful. We need to implement 
a lot more features like being able to view the content of the files, 
hightligh the relevants words in the documents, etc.
