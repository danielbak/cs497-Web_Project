For this first version I was able to finish the front end design as planned.
I used the synfony framework for the back end along with the bootstrap framework for the front-end design.
I also use the composer tool to bundle the different tools and technology that I might need in the future. 
So far I use composer to install synfony and bootstrap.
I have created a home page, login page and register page.
The next step will be to deploy what I have so far on Heroku and creating a login feature.
