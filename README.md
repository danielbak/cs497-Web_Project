Project title: 
Search Engine using Apache Lucene

What is it going to do?
It is a web search engine application that is going to search for results 
into documents online if given a query.
The users of that application will be uploading the documents that they 
want to search through or the users will specify the some already existing 
documents that he/she wants to look through. The query that the user 
enters in the search box will follow an intuitive syntax.

Who is the target audience?
People that are using the website to search through indexing of 
keyword a specific text that they are interested in. User can use that website 
to store documents and do a search later in order to find an information 
that they are interested in. The users of this website will have an account 
that they can access to store the documents that they need. Later the user 
can access his/her account to start searching through his/her documents 
the information that he/she need.

What sort of data will it manage?
It will manage documents that contain text that the user will upload 
into his/her account. Supported files will be .txt, .doc, .pdf for the first version.
For the first version will limit the upload size of a file 
to be a maximum of 10MB. We are also going to limit the size of 
the space allocate into each user account to be about 100MB.

What web technologies will it use?
Apache Lucene, Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML.
The application will be deploy as a java application on the hosting service 
called "Heroku" it will be deploy on a server that will use Appache (preferably).

Stretch Goals?
One long term goal will to increase the number of supported files 
that could be uploaded into the account of the user 
to include .xml, .html, .php, .jsp, .js, databases, etc.
Another long term goal will be to add some filtering on 
the scope where the search will be performed 
to be limited to some specific documents.
